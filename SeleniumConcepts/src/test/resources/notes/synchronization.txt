Topic: Different types of Wait in Selenium / Synchronization in Selenium

 Synchronization is the process of matching the tool speed (selenium) with the application (any web application).
 In order to achieve synchronization in selenium we use one of the following wait statments in selenium

1 Implicit Wait
  * Its a wait statement written globally
  * the wait is applicable for all the elements located using driver.findBy
  * the wait period duration can be from milliseconds to days - but the prefered time should be in seconds
  * the time is upto - example if you have given the time as 10 seconds and the element appeared on 4th second
  * if the element is not located even after the specified time then it will throw "No Such Element" exception.

2 Explicit Wait
  * Its a wait statment written for a specific element
  * We have to create an object of WebdriverWait and specify the conidtion - (there are a lot of inbuilt condition)
  * the wait period duration can be from milliseconds to days - but the prefered time should be in seconds
  * if the element is not located even after the specified time then it will throw "TimeOut" exception.

3 Fluent Wait
  * (I have not used this wait)
  * Its a wait statment written for a specific element just like webdriver wait
  * We can control the polling time 

3 Thread.Sleep
  * Its a hard wait from Java
  * It will force stop the execution for the time specified
